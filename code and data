Data parameters
Time = [0:2:34]
Strain = [0, 0.22, 0.34, 0.41, 0.48, 0.55, 0.62, 0.68, 0.75, 0.82, 0.88, 0.95, 1.03, 1.12, 1.22, 1.36,1.53, 1.77]
This code will graph Time vs. Strain
plot(Time, Strain)

This code will find the steady-state rate- taken from the linear part of the slope
x2 = 28
x1 = 4
y2 = 1.22
y1 = 0.34

steady_state_rate = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
% The steady state rate is about 0.0367 1/min
